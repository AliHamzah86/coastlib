coastlib is a Python library dedicated to solving problems related to the discipline of [coastal engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_engineering). This project pursues the following goals:

- provide a comprehensive toolbox for solving common analytical coastal engineering problems
- provide state-of-art solutions in a simple and accessible form so that engineers and researchers can concentrate on their problem and not the code or underlying math
- provide flexible tools to experienced users so that they can change the code to meet their needs
