Entire code base is currentyl being rewritten. New version with significantly modified tools, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo extreme value analysis, is planned to be released some time early 2019. Please [contact me](mailto:bocharovgeorgii@gmail.com) if you are interested in working on an open-source coastal/ocean engineering library and would like to collaborate.

Below is a sneak peak from the latest version of the Extreme Value Analysis module I have been working on for the last 2 years:

- extreme values extraction and declustering:

- using Markov chain Monte Carlo (using [emcee affine invariant ensemble sampler](http://dfm.io/emcee/current/)) to find posterior distributions of fit parameters:

- plotting return values:
