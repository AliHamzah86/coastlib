Entire code base is currentyl being rewritten. New version with significantly modified tools, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo extreme value analysis, will be released in early 2019. Please contact me if you are interested in working on an open-source coastal/ocean engineering library and would like to collaborate.

Below is a sneak peak from the latest version of the Extreme Value Analysis module I have been working on for the last 2 years:
