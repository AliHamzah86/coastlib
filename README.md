## Project Goals

- provide a comprehensive toolbox for solving common analytical coastal engineering problems
- provide state-of-art solutions in a simple and accessible form so that engineers and researchers can concentrate on their problem and not the code or underlying math
- provide flexible tools to experienced users so that they can change the code to meet their needs

## Examples

Coming soon
